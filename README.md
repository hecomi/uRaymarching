uRaymarching
============
**uRaymarching** is a raymarching shader templates with [uShaderTemplate](https://github.com/hecomi/uShaderTemplate) (the latest version of uShaderTemplate is included in this asset).

- Create a raymarching object only by writting a distance function
- Supports both forward and deferred paths
- Can be mixed with polygon objects
- VR ready
- Standard / Unlit / Transparent
- Shadows for Directional / Spot / Point lights
- Full-screen / Object-space

Screenshots

Install
-------
Please download the latest version of .unitypackage from the [Releases](https://github.com/hecomi/uRaymarching/releases) page and extract it in your project.

How to use
----------

1. Select *Create > Shader > uShaderTemplate > Generator* in the Project view.
2. Input *Shader Name* and select *Shader Template* from Inspector.
3. Edit items in *Conditions*, *Variables*, *Properties*, *Distance Function*, and *Post Effect*.
4. Press *Export* button or *Ctrl + R* to create shader from the `Generator`.
5. Create material in the Project view (or press *Create Material* button).
6. Create *Cube* in the Hierarchy view.
7. Apply the generated material to the cube.

Please also see [uShaderTemplate](https://github.com/hecomi/uShaderTemplate) to learn the detail of shader generation function.

Inspector
---------
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hecomi/uRaymarching/inspector.png" width="720" />

The UI is generated by [uShaderTemplate](https://github.com/hecomi/uShaderTemplate) automatically from template files located in the *Assets/uRaymarching/Editor/Resources/ShaderTemplates*.

Shader Templates
---------------
- Forward > Standard
  - The lighting is done by the same method as a standard surface shader in *ForwardBase/Add* pass.
- Forward > Unlit
  - No lighting by default so you have to write output colors manually.
- Deferred > Standard
  - The lighting is done by the same method as a standard surface shader.
- Deferred > Direct GBuffer
  - Write values directly into GBuffers without thinking the effect like GI or LightProbe.

The items in *Conditions* and *Variables* are different depending on the selected template.

Conditions
----------
- Blend
  - Create a `Blend X X` line.
  - Please check if you want to create a transparent shader.
- Shadow Caster
  - Create `ShadowCaster` pass.
  - Please check if you want a shadow of a raymarching object.
- Full Screen
  - Please check if you use `RamyarchingRenderer` to do fullscreen raymarching.
  - If checked, emit rays from a camera, if not, from a cube polygon surface.
- World Space
  - The given `pos` in a distance function becomes world-space one.
- Follow Object Scale
  - If checked, `pos` in a distance function is scaled by the object scale.
- Camera Inside Object
  - Check if the camera position is inside the object, and then if so, emit ray from camera (not from a polygon surface).
  - Please set the culling as `Cull Off`.
- Use Raymarching Depth
  - If checked, output a raymarching depth, and if not, output a polygon depth.
- Use Camera Depth Texture
  - The occlusion with the other objects is calculated using the `CameraDepthTexture`.
  - Please check in the case that you create a transparent shader and set `ZWrite Off` to a material.
- Spherical Harmonics Per Pixel
  - By default the SH calculation is done in a vertex shader (i.e. only 8 vertices of a cube) but if you create a complex shape and the calculation of the SH is bad, please check this flag to calculate it in a fragment shader (needs more cost than the unchecked case).
- Forward Add
  - Create a `ForwardAdd` pass to calculate the effect from additional lights.
- Fallback To Standard Shader
  - Create a `Fallback` line.
  - If you want a shadow of the polygon object for the better performance, please uncheck *Shadow Caster* and check this.

Variables
---------
- Render Type
  - `RenderType` tag value like `Opaque`, `Transparent`, and `TransparentCutout`.
- Render Queue
  - `Queue` tag value like `Geometry`, `AlphaTest`, and `Transparent`.
- Object Shape
  - Clip the raymarching area inside cube or not (see below).
  - CUBE

Properties
----------
This block is inserted into a `Property` section in a shader.

```shaderlab
[Header(Additional Parameters)]
_Grid("Grid", 2D) = "" {}
```

Distance Function
-----------------
Write a distance function here. The following code is the one generating the example of morphing sphere in *Screenshots* section in this document.

```hlsl
inline float DistanceFunction(float3 pos)
{
    float r = abs(sin(2 * PI * _Time.y / 2.0));
    float d1 = RoundBox(Repeat(pos, float3(6, 6, 6)), 1 - r, r);
    float d2 = Sphere(pos, 3.0);
    float d3 = Plane(pos - float3(0, -3, 0), float3(0, 1, 0));
    return SmoothMin(SmoothMin(d1, d2, 1.0), d3, 1.0);
}
```

*<a href="Assets/uRaymarching/Shaders/Include/Math.cginc">Math.cginc</a>* and *<a href="Assets/uRaymarching/Shaders/Include/Primitives.cginc">Primitives.cginc</a>* is included in the generated shader, so in this example some functions like `RoundBox()` and `Repeat()` come from these include files (of cource you can write them by yourself).

Post Effect
-----------
*Post Effect* is similar to a surface function in a surface shader. The following code is the one of the hexagon-tile example in *Screenshots* section.

```hlsl
float4 _TopColor;

inline void PostEffect(RaymarchInfo ray, inout PostEffectOutput o)
{
    float3 localPos = ToLocal(ray.endPos);
    o.Emission += smoothstep(0.48, 0.50, localPos.y) * _TopColor;
    o.Occlusion *= 1.0 - 1.0 * ray.loop / ray.maxLoop;
}
```

`RaymarchInfo` is the input and the output of a raymarching calculation and this is defined in *Struct.cginc*.

```hlsl
struct RaymarchInfo
{
    // Input
    float3 startPos;    // start position of ray
    float3 rayDir;      // ray direction
    float3 polyNormal;  // normal on polygon surface
    float minDistance;  // minimum ray distance (comes from material setting)
    float maxDistance;  // maximum ray distance (changes by the raymarching setting)
    int maxLoop;        // maximum number of loop (comes from material setting)

    // Output
    int loop;           // total number of loop of the calculation (<= maxLoop)
    float3 endPos;      // last position (= surface of the distance function)
    float lastDistance; // the final distance of the raymarching
    float totalLength;  // total ray length
    float depth;        // depth (encoded)
    float3 normal;      // normal (encoded)
};
```

So `ray.loop / ray.maxLoop` becomes small on the position where a ray reaches easily and becomes big when hard. so you can use `1.0 - ray.loop / ray.maxLoop` as an occlusion factor.

`PostEffectOutput` is defferent depending on the selected shader template. For example, it is an alias of `SurfaceOutputStandard` in *Standard* template. Please see each template file by clicking *Edit* button on the right side of the *Shader Template* drop-down list for more details.

Fullscreen
----------
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hecomi/uRaymarching/world.gif" width="720" />

The `RaymarchingRenderer` component creates a quad plane and renders raymarching objects on it using `CommandBuffer`.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/hecomi/uRaymarching/raymarching-renderer-component.png" width="720" />

Attach a `RayamarchingRenderer` component to an arbitrary object, and create a material which selects a shader created by uRaymarching with the flag of *Full Screen* (please see the *Conditions* section in this document). Then, set it to the *Material* field, and select the rendering timing from the *Pass* drop-down list. You can see the raymarching world with the distance function you write, and it intersects polygon objects.

Please see the following *Known Issues* section regarding the limitation.


Known Issues
------------
### DepthNormalTexture in forward pass

In forward pass, `DepthTexture` is rendererd using the `ShadowCaster` pass but `DepthNormalsTexture` uses the built-in replacement shader.

- [Unity - Manual: Camera's Depth Texture](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-CameraDepthTexture.html)
- [Unity - Manual: Rendering with Replaced Shaders](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-ShaderReplacement.html)

This built-in shader outputs the depth of a polygon surface, so post effects which use `DepthNormalsTexture` like the ambient occlusion in PostProcessing generate wrong results. For now, I don't have any good idea to overwrite it with raymarching results.

### No lighting with `RaymarchingRenderer` in forward path

In forward path, when rendering raymarching objects with `RaymarchingRenderer`, some shader keywords related to the lighting are not defined because it uses `CommandBuffer`. This causes wrong lighting result. So if you want to do fullscreen raymarching in forward path, please create a large box following the camera (as a child of camera), and set `Cull Off` or `Cull Front` flag, then activate `Camera Inside Object`.
